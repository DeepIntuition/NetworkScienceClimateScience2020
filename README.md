## Network Science Analysis on Climate Science Discussions 2020
#### Aalto Life Science Technologies Project Course, Spring 2020, Aalto University

#### Short description
The goal is to obtain understanding and insight Twitter on three US cities around the discussions involving climate change. For this purpose we will conduct both content-based (supervised machine learning) and network-based approaches. We aim to use publicly available tools (open source, open data). The information, obtained from our analyses, could be useful for researchers, political scientists, politicians, and the public at large.
